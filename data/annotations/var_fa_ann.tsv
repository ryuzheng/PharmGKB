1444667615	rs4880	SOD2 (PA36017)	methotrexate (PA450428)	25330300	toxicity	yes	PBMCs were obtained from healthy volunteers and response to methotrexate (MTX) was assessed by genotype. The G allele was associated with a decreased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of MTX (little change in cell proliferation or cell viability upon exposure to MTX). At increasing MTX concentration the GG genotype was also associated with decreased SOD2 protein activity and increased SOD2 gene expression. The ratio of anti-apoptotic/pro-apoptotic gene expression (BAX/Bcl2) was lowest in cells with the AG and GG genotype and highest in the AA genotype cells, indicating that the AA genotype had an increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of MTX. Markers of oxidative stress (gene expression of genes involved in oxidative stress, protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation and ROS levels) were also observed. DNA damage did not differ significantly between groups. The GG genotype showed evidence of decreased oxidative stress upon exposure to MTX. Note: the authors refer to this polymorphism (rs4880) as Ala16Val and each allele as A for alanine or V for valine. The correct AA change is Val16Ala and A>G. Therefore the genotypes in this annotation were determined by the amino acid change that was stated in the study (e.g. in the study the V allele is listed here as the A allele and the A allele is listed here as the G allele).

"Patient B" showed severe growth retardation and was submitted to hospital for upper airway infection. During her stay hypokalaemia was noted and diagnosis of Bartter syndrome suspected. Metabolic screening revealed thymine-uraciluria. No convulsions or neurological abnormalities. Analysis of DPD enzyme activity in fibroblasts of the patient confirmed DPD deficiency. Patient was found to be homozygous for two missense mutations: T85C (C29R) and G2758A (R886H); this combination of alleles is now referred to as DPYD*9B. Analysis of C29R alone showed undetectable activity, and R886H showed 40% of normal activity (mutations were introduced separately into a wild-type DPD cDNA and subcloned into a pSE420 expression vector).

Mutations at codon 543 (DPYD*5) were analyzed in a set of 23 patients. 10 were heterozygotes (DPYD activity 44.1-335.4 pmol/min/mg) and 1 was a homozygote (DPYD activity 66.1 pmol/min/mg). One of the heterozygotes also was a heterozygote for *2A. The combination of *2A and *5 on the same allele is referred to as DPYD*2B, however, the authors did not comment on whether these were on the same or different alleles. The authors state that the high frequency of mutations at codon 543 and the large range of DPD enzyme activity (44.1-335.4 pmol/min/mg) suggest that this is a common polymorphism and is not itself associated with low enzyme activity. Note that the mean DPD activity for the entire patient population was 210 pmol/min/mg; the authors comment that a cut-off value for suspected heterozygous DPD deficiency has been suggested at 100 pmol/min/mg, though <60 pmol/min/mg (below lower limit of the 95% distribution range) perhaps should be considered.

Note that the diplotype of "Patient A" (*3/*8; DPYD deficiency (autosomal recessive disease)) was reported in PMID 9439663. In THIS study, the patient was noted as having the genotype *3/??. DPD enzymatic activity in Patient A was 0.0015 nmol product/h/mg protein (control = 1.12 +/- 0.7 nmol product/h/mg protein). The father of Patient A was completely DPD deficient. The uncle of Patient A had reduced DPD activity (0.41 nmol product/h/mg protein). The uncle had the *1/*3 genotype and the father had the *3/*3 genotype. Please note that the paper does not use the * allele nomenclature for this variant, but rather refers to it as "a single base pair deletion at position C1897...lead[ing] to a frameshift and a premature stop codon shortly thereafter".
