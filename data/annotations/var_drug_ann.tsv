The overall genome-wide association has significance p = 1.37 x 10 -28. Based upon the allele frequency in different population groups, this polymorphism appears to explain about half of the response rate difference between different populations. An association between baseline viral load and genotype was also found.

[stat_test:linear regression]. More than 90% of participants were receiving 25 mg/day HCTZ (the rest received 12.5 mg/day). This did not replicate significantly in a second cohort(GERA) and authors concluded that there could possibly be an association between this SNP and blood pressure response to HCTZ in Caucasians, but that it requires further investigation. Significance for this segment of the study was set at p < 0.01 for a partially corrected p, and in Whites, this level was met when a partial correction for multiple testing was done. But for a compound, corrected p predetermined by the authors to be the significance point for both segments of the study, the significance test failed.

Using these models, dosing simulations were used to predict how covariate effects (including metabolizer status) could be used to optimize voriconazole concentrations (2-5 mg/L) in patients with different CYP2C19 genotypes. The authors report that *1/*1+*1/*17 genotypes had (41.2%) higher Vmax (mg/h) than *1/*2+*2/*2 genotypes. The model predicted that 72% (oral regimen) and 63% (intravenous regimen) of subjects with *1/*1+*1/*17 genotypes would have voriconazole trough concentrations of < 2mg/L on day 7 if given twice daily 200 mg doses. Increasing the dosage to 300mg twice daily would decrease the probability of having <2mg/L of voriconazole to 49% (oral) and 35%(intravenous).

Predictive power of algorithms was highest for patients in the ideal-dose range and lowest for patients in the low and high dose range. The most accurate predictions came from three Han-Chinese PGx warfarin dosing algorithms (Du et al. 2010, Huang et al. 2009, Miao et al. 2007).	Genotype AA is associated with decreased dose of warfarin in people with heart valve replacement as compared to genotypes AG + GG.	"1184169095","1184169107"	AA

Increased CYP3A5 expression in the distal tubules was shown to be protective against CNIT, however, CYP3A5 expression in the proximal tubules was associated with increased CNIT occurrence. Though the investigators determined the specific CYP3A5 genotype of the proximal and distal tubules (*1/*3, *3/*3), they were not able to show a significant association between genotype and actual protein expression with immunohistochemistry. (Typically, one would expect decreased or null expression for the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype). In their subject population, all subjects demonstrated some degree of CYP3A5 expression. As a result, no association between a specific proximal and/or distal tubule CYP3A5 genotype and the occurrence of CNIT could be determined.

These genotypes were often found together. 98% of patients with GT1 (d), 100% of patients with GT1(t), 96% of patients with HCV genotype 2, 92% of patients with HCV genotype 3 and 98% of patients with HCV genotype 4 had those genotype combinations. rs8099917 TT was the strongest predictor of SVR in GT1(t) patients (p=0.026) and was strongly correlated with SVR in patients infected with HCV genotype 4 (P<0.001). In univariate analysis, the TT genotype was a significant predictor of SVR in GT1(d) (p<0.01) and GT1(t) (p=0.02). The TT genotype was found to be significant in a multivariate analysis of predictive factors of SVR within all HCV genotype 1 infected patients. The CC genotype was also associated with higher HCV RNA concentration at baseline in patients with HCV genotype 3 (p=0.005), 2/3 (p=0.017) and GT1(d) (p<0.001) as well as increased ALT levels in HCV genotype 2/3 (p=0.077).	Genotype TT is associated with increased response to peginterferon alfa-2a, peginterferon alfa-2b, ribavirin or telaprevir in people with Hepatitis C, Chronic as compared to genotypes GG + GT.

The mean group CL/F values for the four different categories of CYP2D6-inferred metabolic status were 53 L/hr (UM), 34 L/hr (EM), 27 L/hr (IM) and 18 L/hr (PM). Please note, no specific alleles or genotypes for CYP2D6 were reported. The article stated the following categorization of CYP2D6 phenotypes: 'Alleles with full functionality were assigned a gene dose of 1 and alleles with reduced functionality a value of 0.5, while alleles with no functionality were assigned a value of zero. If the sum of the gene dose for the alleles was zero, the inferred metabolic status was categorized as poor metaboliser (PM), if the sum was 0.5 or 1, the category was intermediate metaboliser (IM), if the sum was 1.5 or 2, the category was extensive metaboliser (EM) and for a sum over 2, the category was set to ultra metaboliser (UM)'.	CYP2D6 poor metabolizers is associated with decreased clearance of vortioxetine in healthy individuals as compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.	1444665889

Patients with HCV genotype 1 were divided into groups receiving dual therapy (GT1 (d); peg-intron alpha 2a/b, ribavirn) or triple therapy (GT1 (t); peg-intron alpha 2a/b, ribavirn, telaprevir). Sustained virological response (SVR) is a measure of therapeutic efficacy. Variables that were significant in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. The authors designated three "beneficial" genotypes that were found at higher frequencies in patients who achieved SVR: rs12979860 CC, rs8099917 TT, rs368234815 TT/TT. These genotypes were often found together. 98% of patients with GT1 (d), 100% of patients with GT1(t), 96% of patients with HCV genotype 2, 92% of patients with HCV genotype 3 and 98% of patients with HCV genotype 4 had those genotype combinations. rs368234815 TT/TT was the only single SNP significant predictor of SVR in patients with HCV genotype 3. Although rs368234815 TT/TT was significantly associated with SVR in univariate analysis, in a multivariate analysis of predictive factors of SVR within all genotype 1 infected patients the TT/TT genotype was not found to be significant. The TT/TT genotype was also associated with increases ALT levels in patients with HCV genotype 2 (p=0.018),3 (p=0.035) and 2/3 (p=0.006) as well as a higher HCV RNA concentration at baseline in GT1 (d) (p<0.001) and GT(t) patients (p=0.007). *Note: TT is a single allele whereas the other allele substitutes TT for a single G so the WT genotype is TT/TT.
